                    <h3>Who I Am</h3>
                    <p>I am Carl Xoos, a Grade 12 ABM student at Prenza National High School with a strong passion for technology and web development. Despite my business-focused academic track, I have dedicated myself to learning programming and building real-world projects.</p>
                    <p>My journey in web development started with curiosity and has evolved into a commitment to becoming a full stack developer. I believe in learning by doing, which is why I have already built several functional websites using modern web technologies.</p>
                    <p>Beyond coding, I enjoy drawing anime characters as a creative outlet and playing chess as a beginner, constantly learning new strategies. I'm naturally shy and quiet in real life, preferring to keep to myself. As a night owl, I'm most active during the nighttime when everything is peaceful and quiet. I'm naturally curious about many things and love exploring new ideas and concepts.</p>
                    <p>I'm comfortable working independently and used to doing things on my own, but I can also collaborate effectively in team settings when needed. I also have a strong interest in math and physics, even though they can be challenging. Currently, I stay focused on my studies even when I get tired, and I genuinely enjoy helping others without expecting anything in return. I am focused on mastering frontend development and expanding my skill set to include backend technologies. My goal is to launch my career as a professional full stack developer by 2029.</p>

                    <p>A fun project I decided to create for my classmates' entrepreneurship week stall. Built a web application featuring a secure authentication system with a login page requiring email and password. After logging in, users can view their drinks product catalog including product logo, name, tagline, and more. The platform includes navigation links for research references, a Firebase realtime feedback system, team information, and a logout page. I placed a QR code (containing embedded login credentials) above their booth so customers could scan and instantly access the platform. Successfully deployed on Netlify.</p>
